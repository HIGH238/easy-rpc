# Easy RPC

This is a simple and easy to use app that allows you to set a custom [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/rich-presence).
I made this cause I had nothing else to do. So yeah.

## Features
- Multiple profile support with import/export options *(i.e profile sharing)*
- Option to dock to system tray *(i.e there's no need to keep the app window open! It will run in background if enabled!)*
- Option to auto-launch on startup *(i.e there's no need to even open the app! If enabled it will automatically start, hook to discord and dock to system tray!)*
- An easy to understand help section that will allow you to easily create your first RPC profile!
